This application is part of the final assessment of Information Security Management as part of PgDip in Computer science at the University of Essex Online. The goal of this application is to create threat profiles according to the OCTAVE-S risk assessment framework.

## About

 The application accepts JSON files that contain threat properties according to the OCTAVE-S framework (Alberts & Dorofee, n.d). Each JSON file could contain information about several threats to several assets in one scenario. The data that needs to be supplied in the JSON file contains Asset, Access (Optional), Actors, Motives (Optional) and Outcomes), along with probability and impact scores. The software will then generate threat profiles and calculate PI score for each threat profile, in addition to a total PI score for the scenario to allow comparison.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will guide you on how to run this python script.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 is needed to run this project.

If you don't have python installed on your computer, follow this link to install it [python](https://www.python.org).

You can check if you have python 3 installed by running the following command on the terminal (MacOS) or command prompt (Windows)

```
python --version
```
Example output:

```
Python 3.11.1
```

### Downloading the code and setting up the virtual environment

- Download the project folder [Threat-Profile](https://github.com/drmohammadatieh/Threat-Profile/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

- Open the terminal on MacOS or the command prompt on Windows 7/10.
- Go to the directory that contains the project files. Example:
  
  In MacOS:
  
  ```
  cd  Downloads/Threat-Profile-main/
  ```
  In Windows:

   ```
  cd  Downloads\Threat-Profile-main\
  ```
- Create a virtual environment:

```
python-m venv .venv
```
Activate the virtual environment

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the script

Run the script

  ```
  python threat_profile.py
  ```

## Application instructions

The application will process the JSON files located in the 'data' folder, generate threat profiles and PI (Probability-Impact)impact scores, and export them to the 'output' folder. The 'output' folder will contain other folders that have the names of the projects. Each project folder will contain other folders that have the names of the analyzed scenarios.

Each output for each analysis is composed of different threat profiles, and a 'PI Score.txt' file will contain the PI score of each threat profile, in addition to total PI score for the scenario.

### A threat profile example

An example of a threat profile generated by the application is shown below:

<img src="images/store_current.jpg" width="900">

The first category on the left is "Access". The Next one is the "Actors", followed by the "Motives", then the outcomes. The first number group on the left represents the probability. Probability is calculated by the probability of the actor, or the probability of the actor added to the probability of the motive. The second number group on the right represents the PI scores. The PI score is the product of probability (probability of the actor/ the actor & motive) multiplied by the impact of the outcome. The total PI score for the threat profile is shown on the third line of the title. 

### JSON file structure

  A JSON file structure is shown below followed by a description.

<img src="images/json.jpg" width="300">

  The JSON file contains the following main key-vale pairs:
  - **Project**, for the project name ("Pampered Pets" in the sample data)
  - **Analysis**, for the analysis name ("Current Status" and "Digitalized" in the sample data).
  - **Assests** for an array of the threat profiles properties. Each Asset contains the following key-vale pairs:
    - **Name**, for the asset name.
    - **Access**, for the access. For example, network access or physical access.
    - **Actors**, for the actors. For example inside or outside actors. Each one has **Probability** attribute that will be used for the calculation of the PI score.
    - **Motives**, for the motives. For example, accidental or deliberate. Each one has **Probability** attribute as well.
    - **Outcomes**, for the possible outcomes. Each one has an **Impact** attribute that will be used for the PI score calculation.
    - **Impossible** for an array of the impossible actor-motive and actor-motive-outcome combinations in array format that will be excluded from the processing. For example, ["Outside","Accidental"] means that the application will not connect an outside actor to an accidental motive during the threat profile generation process and PI score calculation.
